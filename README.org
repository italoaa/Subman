#+title: Subman

This utility aims to help you manage your subtitles. For now it only helps you rename your subtitles to the name of the episode it corresponds. This allows programs like ~mpv~ to find this subtitle automatically when you play any media.

* Usage
There are 4 variables that can be supplied as command line arguments:
#+begin_src sh
Usage: subman [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -s, --subtitle-extension <SUBTITLE_EXTENSION>          [default: srt]
  -v, --video-extension <VIDEO_EXTENSION>                [default: mkv]
      --video-regex-episode <VIDEO_REGEX_EPISODE>        [default: E(\d{2})]
      --subtitle-regex-episode <SUBTITLE_REGEX_EPISODE>  [default: (\d{2})]
  -h, --help                                             Print help

#+end_src

From all these arguments the regex have to be in the form that is accepted by the regex create in cargo ([[https://crates.io/crates/regex][regex]])

** Example
Say you have files in the form:
#+begin_src text
nameS01E01.mkv
nameS01E02.mkv
nameS01E03.mkv
randomName01.srt
randomName02.srt
randomName03.srt
#+end_src
we can use the basic command and the rest will be done for us (because of the defaults)
#+begin_src sh
subman
#+end_src

resulting in
#+begin_src text
nameS01E01.mkv
nameS01E01.srt
nameS01E02.mkv
nameS01E02.srt
nameS01E03.mkv
nameS01E03.srt
#+end_src



* Future
This project is simple and I will add to it as my needs increase for further management of subtitles
